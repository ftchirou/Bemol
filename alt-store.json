      "localizedDescription": "Bemol is a free and open-source functional ear training app that helps you develop relative pitch. Bemol helps you learn to recognize each musical note by having you internalize how the note relates to its nearest tonic in a given key. This is achieved through practice sessions where Bemol will play some notes and you identify them by playing them back on the keyboard.\n\nFor each note that you have to identify, Bemol will first play a short cadence to establish the key in your ear. Once you identify the note, Bemol will play a short melody to resolve the note back to the tonic. It is this resolution that will cement the relationship between the note and the tonic in your ear. Do not worry if at first, you're getting most of the notes wrong. It's part of the process. Just relax and listen to the final resolution. Your brain will connect the dots.\n\nPractice a little bit everyday and eventually you will be able to clearly distinguish the qualities of each note in a given key.\n\nHowever, please note that while being able to identify individual notes is a fundamental and valuable skill, it alone will not automatically enable you to \"play by ear\" complex pieces or songs. Ideally, Bemol should be a part of a balanced ear practice regimen that includes rhythm training, chord quality recognition, tension/resolution perception, and a little bit of music theory.\n\nBemol is a free and open-source software. We will never run ads, collect your data, or try to monetize your experience in the app in any way. Bemol is and will be free forever.\n\nBemol is an open-source adaptation of the excellent and free Functional Ear Trainer app developed by Alain Benbassat for desktop operating systems. All credit for the training method is due to Alain.\n\nThe source code is available on Github at https://github.com/ftchirou/Bemol.",
